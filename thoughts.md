How can I reduce the amount of search and also learn what I need to learn from the push_swap?

I have heard so many complains from others about this project. If I remembered what I read from the book Get Better At Anything, the first essential topic is to See. I know I have a misconception: I will need to do everything on my own. If i didn't come up with a solution, I am losing it. However, the next chapter of the book is literally about different kinds of problem-solving. You can solve some unsolved problems without any help, and it will be about huge amount of time for a search, or you can memorise some methods/techniques to reduce amount of a search. 

My key question is that **what exactly should we do for 42 London?** If my goal is to be really good at programming and conduct a project that I have never done before, what are a course of action I should take?

My initial thought would be that I need to learn this and that. For example, it mentions about the analysis of algorithm in the subject.pdf. In the past, I would dive into every piece of information about a topic with an aim of being familiar with it. However, regardless of the perfect intentions, this behaviour usually quickly makes me overwhelmed. The actual course is that I throw myself to a large problem space. 

I learned that sufficient practice should be okay. But the quality of practice is also important.

#### What to learning

I always think about what the studying method should be. Cause I can watch any videos on YouTube, second by second to ensure I could grasp the concepts. But sometimes 20-minute video will usually take me 2 hours to complete the "dictation". However, I could understand why this could feel like "effective", except it isn't. Because I will totally forgot everything in 3 days. So the 2 hours are a total waste.  

The definition of a skill is that you can retrieve knowledge and apply it to the right context at any time. It seems like that we just need to put everything into flashcard-like Anki. However, people often praise about The Frayman Technique. Pick one topic and explain. If stuck, go back to learn. I like this method because it does help me deepen the concept understanding. But the thing is that I felt it difficult as a foreigner.
