How can I reduce the amount of search and also learn what I need to learn from the push_swap?

I have heard so many complains from others about this project. If I remembered what I read from the book Get Better At Anything, the first essential topic is to See. I know I have a misconception: I will need to do everything on my own. If i didn't come up with a solution, I am losing it. However, the next chapter of the book is literally about different kinds of problem-solving. You can solve some unsolved problems without any help, and it will be about huge amount of time for a search, or you can memorise some methods/techniques to reduce amount of a search. 

My key question is that what exactly should we do for 42 London? If my goal is to be really good at programming and conduct a project that I have never done before, what are a course of action I should take?

My initial thought would be that I need to learn this and that. For example, it mentions about the analysis of algorithm in the subject.pdf. In the past, I would dive into every piece of information about a topic with an aim of being familiar with it. However, regardless of the perfect intentions, this behaviour usually quickly makes me overwhelmed. The actual course is that I throw myself to a large problem space.
